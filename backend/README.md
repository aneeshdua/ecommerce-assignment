# Ecommerce Backend

- This project was made using Java 21.0.1 and Spring Boot.
- The data is fetched from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/products) and stored in an in-memory H2 database. The data is then exposed through REST API endpoints.
- The application is configured to initialise the database at startup.


## Features
- Since there is no Brand endpoint to leverage for the filtering on the frontend, please create one. Please include how you would handle unit/integration testing, validations, and error handling for this new endpoint. You may store the source data anyway youâ€™d like.
