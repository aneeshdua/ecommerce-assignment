# Ecommerce Assignment

## Requirements

### Frontend (React or your choice)

Leverage this Store endpoint API to build an e-commerce product catalog (preferably in React).

[https://dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products)

The site should display a product catalog with the following features:

- Display images of the product with description, price, category, and rating.
- Display 10 products then paginate.
- Include a sort by feature by:
    - Product Title
    - Price - low to high
    - Price - high to low
- Add the following filters:
    - Category
    - Brand
- Add a search bar to search for Product. Leverage the search endpoint or enhance with your own logic.
- Provide a detailed product page after clicking on a product.
- Provide a main product image along with all the product detail information provided by the product endpoint.

Please use best practices of SPA, CSS, etc.

### Backend (Spring Boot, Node.js your choice)

Since there is no Brand endpoint to leverage for the filtering on the frontend, please create one. Please include how you would handle unit/integration testing, validations, and error handling for this new endpoint. You may store the source data anyway youâ€™d like.
